# Calculator_flet_python_library
 calculator using python flet library
 
Import Necessary Libraries:

import flet as ft

Define the Main Function:
The main function will create the calculator interface and handle the windows.

def main(pg: ft.Page):

Set Up the Main Window:
Specify the properties of the main window where the calculator interface will be displayed, such as width, height, title, etc.


    pg.title = "Calculator"
    pg.window_width = 300
    pg.window_height = 400
    pg.window_resizable = False
    
Create Interface Elements:
Create the necessary interface elements for the calculator (buttons, text boxes, etc.) that will capture and process user interactions.

    result_text = ft.Text(value="", size=40)
Define Event Handlers:
Define event handlers to capture and process user interactions, such as when a number button is pressed or when a calculation is performed.

    def update_result(value):
        nonlocal expression
        expression += value
        result_text.value = expression

    def clear():
        nonlocal expression
        expression = ""
        result_text.value = ""

    def calculate():
        nonlocal expression
        try:
            result = eval(expression)
            result_text.value = str(result)
            expression = str(result)
        except Exception as e:
            result_text.value = "Error"
            expression = ""
Add Interface Elements:
Add the prepared interface elements to the main window. This provides the user with the calculator interface to interact with.

    pg.add(
        result_text,
        # Add buttons and other interface elements here
    )
    
Update the Application:
Call the main function and update the application to display the calculator interface and capture interactions.

    pg.update()
    
Start the Application:
Target the main function and start the application to make the calculator ready for use.

ft.app(target=main)
By following these steps, you can create a simple calculator using the flet library.
